Lavazza uses a modern process of decaffeination with carbon dioxide that does not diminish the flavor and aroma of the roasted coffee beans, a potential downfall of the Swiss water process. The use of carbon dioxide and pure water also avoids the use of potentially harmful substances in the decaffeination process. What to expect from Lavazza's Dek Decaf? A medium-bodied, full flavored espresso roast with no bitter aftertaste. Amaze your friends and family, they won't believe it is decaffeinated. Try a taste test and see!

As one of the most well known and historic coffee blends, how does Zoka Coffee, a small artisan roaster in Seattle, improve upon perfection? Zoka took the flavor profile and re-imagined it with what is available now in sustainable agriculture. Instead of coffee from the island of Java, they found a savory, syrupy source in Indonesia. For the bright fruit forward component they bypassed Yemen in favor of Ethiopia. If you are not familiar with the flavor, Zoka Java has a balanced flavor: full earthy body, moderate acidity, nut-like chocolaty flavors and fruity floral high notes."
